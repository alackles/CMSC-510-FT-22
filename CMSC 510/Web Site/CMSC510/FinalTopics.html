<h3>Topics for the final</h3>
<p>The final exam for this course will be comprehensive, and will cover all of the topics we have already covered on the midterm exams along with new topics since midterm two.</p>
<p>Here is a list of topics we have covered since the second midterm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parallel algorithms: know how to use the spawn, sync, and parallel for pseudocode keywords.</li>
<li>String matching algorithms: know how the Rabin-Karp and Finite State string matching algorithms work.</li>
<li>Computational graphics: know how the cross product operation works and how to use it to find intersections of line segments. Know how to compute a polar angle and how to use polar angles to implement Graham Scan and Jarvis's March.</li>
<li>NP-completeness: know the definitions of key NP-complete problems such as formula satisfiability, the clique problem, vertex covers, Hamiltonial cycles, and the subset-sum problem.</li>
<li>Approximation algorithms: be familiar with the approximation algorithms for vertex cover, the traveling salesman problem, and subset sum.</li>
</ol>
<p>The exam will be more heavily weighted toward new topics. Here also is a priority list of important topics from previous exams that I may ask about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the master theorem to solve recurrence relations and estimate runtimes.</li>
<li>Key graph algorithms, including BFS, DFS, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms, and Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
<li>Using recursion to solve problems involving finding optimal subsets, such as the Knapsack problem or the subset sum problem.</li>
</ol>
