<h4>Midterm One Topics</h4>
<p>Midterm one will cover chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Here is a list of topics for you to review.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Estimating the best case and worst case run time for iterative algorithms.</li>
	<li>Solving recurrences via a call tree, substitution, and the Master Theorem</li>
	<li>Using random variables in run time estimates</li>
	<li>Selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and Quicksort</li>
	<li>Using loop invariants to prove that iterative algorithms are correct.</li>
	<li>Using proof by induction to prove that recursive algorithms are correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exam will be a closed book exam. I will allow you to bring a single sheet of paper with
useful formulas on it to use as a reference.</p>
